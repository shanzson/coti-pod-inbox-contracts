/// @notice Locks a public ERC20 and mints/burns its PoD private pToken counterpart.
/// @dev The portal never speaks to the inbox directly. Value-holding PoD messaging is confined to the
///      paired {IPodERC20} (pToken), which authenticates inbound legs (peer for success, linked return
///      leg for errors). The portal only reacts to successful pToken callbacks (e.g. {onPTokenTransferred}
///      requires `msg.sender == address(pToken)`) and records public bridge obligations — prefer this
///      indirection for anything that escrows user funds instead of putting inbox handlers on the portal.
///      Split deploy-then-initialize is unsafe on clones; use {PrivacyPortalFactory.createPortal} or an equivalent atomic path.
///      Admin/operator auth is resolved via {bindingFactory} (survives remount). Live deposit/withdraw entrypoints also require
///      a non-zero active {factory} binding (cleared on remount detach).
